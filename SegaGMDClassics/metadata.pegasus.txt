    strange phone call.\n
    The caller doesn’t reveal his name — he only asks the Bonanzas
    to meet him at a special time and place. They hesitate at first, but
    the caller’s last words stick in their minds. “I’m certain that this will
    prove to be a very lucrative partnership...”\n
    Mike and Spike arrive at the boarded-up front of what used to be
    a grocery store. “He said we should go in,” says Mike, and in they
    go, wondering just what’s going on.\n
    “Yo! Anybody here?” shouts Spike into the darkness. Suddenly a sharp click
    and  a flash of light send the Bonanzas diving for cover.\n
    “It’s a set up!” they yell. They lift up their heads slowly to check the
    room. The TV has been mysteriously
    turned on, and a figure begins speaking to them.\n
    “I can’t give you my name. I’ll just tell you that I’m a businessman with a
    problem. Many of my properties have been targets for robbery recently. I
    don’t know why they’ve been hit, but it’s become quite a costly situation. I
    need the two of you, the renowned Bonanza Brothers, to test my security
    forces. I have already had various items — money, papers and the like
    — placed randomly in ten of my establishments. Your job is to retrieve
    every single item. If you succeed, the reward will make Fort Knox look like
    pocket change. Good luck...”\n
    The figure fades out, and the Bonanzas stare at a screen full of static.
    “Ya think this guy’s on the up an’ up?”
    Mike asks his brother, “I’ll tell ya what.” Spike replies, “We’re sure
    gonna find out!”

description: ToeJam & EarlTM are both highly funky aliens from the
    planet Funkotron. Recently they ran into a slight problem...\n
    They were cruising in their highly funky, ultra cool, righteous
    rapmaster rocketship when Earl said he’d like a shot at driving. To
    cut a long story short, the rocketship is now in pieces spread over
    the most insane planet in the galaxy – planet Earth!\n
    All they have to do now is find the ten pieces of their rocketship
    and they’re on their way. Doesn’t sound so hard does it?

    discovers a mutant strain of insects that have begun to flourish
