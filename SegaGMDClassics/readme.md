# Frontend for the SEGA's Mega Drive & Genesis Classics collection.

The metadata is written for the Pegasus frontend software and made with Linux users on mind. However, it can work in other operational system if adapted.

## Features that differentiate this frontend from the original:

1. Faster menu.
2. Better emulation.
3. Gameplay demonstration for each game.
4. Real 3D box art for each game.
5. Easier region selection.
6. More agility to read the manuals.
7. Worse: don't have the 3D room.
9. Worse: don't have internet content (e.g., achievements, cloud save, leaderboards)

## Install:

1. Find in your Steam files the folders: "SEGAGameRoom_Data/StreamingAssets", "manuals", and "uncompressed ROMs".
2. From "SEGAGameRoom_Data/StreamingAssets", copy the following files to SegaGMDClassics (folder containing the Pegasus metadata): "PS4SessionImage.png", "PS4SessionImageUsa.png", "PS4_Trailer_Megadrive.mp4", and "PS4_Trailer_Genesis.mp4".
3. Copy every file in the "manuals" folder to SegaGMDClassics.
4. Copy every file in the "uncompressed ROMs" folder to SegaGMDClassics as well.
5. Configure Pegasus to include SegaGMDClassics as a ROMs directory.
6. Install the emulator blast-em and make sure you can run it through terminal with the command "blastem". You can configure it now if you want to. The command "sudo apt install blastem" should be enough to install the emulator.
