# GOG_Shorts

Shortcuts created from GOG Galaxy does not launch Galaxy before launching the games. Launching only the game, without launching Galaxy first, disables time counting, cloud saves, achievements, and other features. This app creates shortcuts automatically that leverage all those benefits of DRM.

## Usage

The usage is simple, but you should create a config file before using:

- Create config file: MyDocuments->GOG_Shorts->config.txt
- The content of the config file should be "Full\Path\to\GalaxyClient.exe" (between quotation marks)
- Keep the original installation structure and drag and drop the file names goggame-gameID.ico onto GOG_Shorts

PS1: The most common path to the Galaxy client is "C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe"

PS2: If there is no goggame-gameID.ico in the game folder, you have to create one
